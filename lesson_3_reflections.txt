1) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
 >> When I want to share my project and changes with other people, specially when this people is far away so we just can work remotely.
2) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
 >> Because you know when this pulls won't interfer with your local changes.
3) Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
 >> Fork is a github copy system that allows people copy repositories from others without losing the link with the creator. Clones are copies of a repository into your local repository. And branches are new commits that splits from your local repository.
4) What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
 >> you can compare potential bugs that are or are not in the remote.
5) How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
 >> Using e-mail and chats, working on encapsulated features.
 >> Would be easier not having to learn git xD and would be harder merging the project together by hand.
6) When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
 >> When I want to make a new feature or fix a bug or anything with the code that I'm not sure if it's going to be for sure in the main project.
